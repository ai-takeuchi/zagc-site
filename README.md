# ZAGC

ZAGC is your static site's best companion:

<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 1em;">
  <li>ðŸš€ Blazing-fast builds with Zola</li>
  <li>ðŸ¤– Smooth automation via GitHub Actions</li>
  <li>ðŸ§  Flexible headless content management with Cockpit CMS</li>
</ul>

Build fast, update easily, and deploy âœ¨

ðŸ§ª **Note**: ZAGC is in an early testing phase. Itâ€™s under development and currently being trialed in real-world scenarios.

---

## Overview

**ZAGC** is a lightweight and flexible template stack designed for building and managing static websites.
It integrates multiple tools to automate everything from content management to build and deployment:

* [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) â€“ A Rust-based static site generator
* [Cockpit CMS](https://getcockpit.com/) â€“ A headless CMS
* GitHub Actions â€“ For automated builds and deployments

---

## How It Works

1. Fetch content and assets from Cockpit
2. Convert to Markdown (compatible with Zola)
3. Convert and resize uploaded images to `.webp`
4. Build the static site using Zola
5. Upload to the public server
6. Archive the current website on GitHub (for version history)

---

## Optimized for Migration from Other Environments

ZAGC is intended as a practical alternative for users facing challenges with traditional dynamic CMS systems.

Examples of systems you can migrate from:

* Headless CMS that provide content via REST API
* Cloud services allowing posting and image upload via admin UI
* Traditional CMS using themes and templates for visual design

ZAGC focuses on the following to ensure smooth and natural operation post-migration:

### âœ… Structure-Aware Content Conversion

* Converts standard structures like posts, pages, tags, and categories into Zola-compatible Markdown
* Supports flexible schema designs including custom fields

### âœ… Automated Asset Processing

* Downloads images along with content and converts them to `.webp` by use case
* Automatically generates thumbnails, medium, and large sizes
* Removes original images to reduce storage footprint

### âœ… Optimized for Static Site Operation

* Automates build and publish via GitHub Actions
* Enables fast updates and minimizes deployment errors
* Reduces infrastructure dependency so you can focus on content

With this setup, you can break free from the limitations and performance concerns of dynamic CMSs, and run a website focused on **maintainability, speed, and freedom**.

## âœ… How to Obtain a GitHub Token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`)

### 1. Log in to GitHub

Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

---

### 2. Navigate to the Token Creation Page

- Click on your profile icon at the top right corner and select `Settings`.
- In the left sidebar, select `Developer settings` â†’ `Personal access tokens` â†’ `Tokens (classic)`.
- Click on **"Generate new token (classic)"**.

---

### 3. Configure the Token

- **Note**: Provide a label or note for the token (e.g., `Deploy Trigger Token`).
- **Expiration**: Set an expiration date (recommended: `90 days` or `No expiration`).
- **Scopes (permissions)**: Check at least the following scopes:
  - âœ… `repo` (to access your repository)
  - âœ… `workflow` (to manage GitHub Actions workflows)

---

### 4. Save the Token

The token will only be displayed once. Make sure to copy it and store it securely.

Add the following to your `.env.php` file.

## Notes and Design Principles

* **Fixed version of Zola** to avoid future compatibility issues
* `.bin/` and `zola/public/` are excluded from Git version control via `.gitignore`
* Efficient syncing: **delta downloads** and asset cleanup from Cockpit to minimize traffic
* Go scripts use **direct CLI tool calls** (e.g. ImageMagick) without Go modules
* GitHub Actions installs required tools like `imagemagick` and `webp` using:

```yaml
- name: Install ImageMagick and WebP tools
  run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y imagemagick webp
```

---

## Roadmap & Future Improvements

* Better error handling and logging
* Generalization of templates and configuration
* Further optimization for migration scenarios

---

## Zola Template Features

* **Categories**: Organize and group your content with category support.
* **Breadcrumbs**: Easily navigate your siteâ€™s hierarchy with breadcrumbs.
* **Code Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks for better readability.
* **Prev/Next Links**: Seamlessly move to the previous or next post in the section.
* **Sidebar**: A handy sidebar for additional navigation or widgets.
* **Hamburger Menu**: A responsive hamburger menu for mobile-friendly navigation.
* **Inquiry Send Mail**: Contact form functionality to send inquiries via email.
